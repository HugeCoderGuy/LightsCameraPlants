# LightsCameraPlants
## Summary:
Included are all of the necessary files to complete automated measurements of leaf area for plants grown in a lab setting. Measurements of the plants are taken in a standardized 3D printed enclosure that eliminates common issues such as glare, camera positioning, and image cropping. This alleviates much of the post-processing required with other automated phenotyping methods and allows the user to identify leaf area measurements in the real-time. The Python file lightsandcamera.py was written to operate on a raspberry pi with neopixels lights and a USB camera.
